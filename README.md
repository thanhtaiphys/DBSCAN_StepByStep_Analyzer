# DBSCAN_StepByStep_Analyzer
**Analyze Phase Space Files from TOPAS-nBio**

This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Python and Tkinter to analyze **phase space files (.phsp)** generated by TOPAS-nBio using DBSCAN and Step-by-Step methods.
Users can choose from two different types of scoring: **DBSCAN** and **Step-by-Step**. The application allows users to select a directory containing .phsp files and automatically processes these files to create an Excel file containing the analysis results.
